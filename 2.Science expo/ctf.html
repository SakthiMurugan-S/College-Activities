	<h2>What is capture the flag hacking? </h2>
	<p>
This blog is designed for a person that is brand-new to Capture The Flag (CTF) hacking and explains the basics to give you the courage to enter a CTF and see for yourself what’s it’s like to participate. CTFs are events that are usually hosted at information security conferences, including the various BSides events. These events consist of a series of challenges that vary in their degree of difficulty, and that require participants to exercise different skillsets to solve. Once an individual challenge is solved, a “flag” is given to the player and they submit this flag to the CTF server to earn points. Players can be lone wolves who attempt the various challenges by themselves, or they can work with others to attempt to score the highest number of points as a team.
CTF events are usually timed, and the points are totaled once the time has expired. The winning player / team will be the one that solved the most challenges and thus secured the highest score.
